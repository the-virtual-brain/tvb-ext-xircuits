# tvb-ext-xircuits

This is a jupyterlab extension built as a prototype for building EBRAINS 
(including TVB simulator, Siibra API) workflows in a visual and interactive manner. It 
extends the already existent [Xircuits](https://xircuits.io/) jupyterlab extension 
by adding new components and new features on top.

For installing in a Jupyter Lab environment:

    pip install tvb-ext-xircuits


For dev mode setup, you need to have a dedicated `Python env`, `yarn`, `rust` and `cargo` 
(from https://rustup.rs/) prepared:

    conda activate [my-env]
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -e .
    yarn install
    yarn install:extension
    xircuits
