# tvb-ext-xircuits

This is a jupyterlab extension built as a prototype for building EBRAINS 
(including TVB simulator, Siibra API) workflows in a visual and interactive manner. It 
extends the already existent [Xircuits](https://xircuits.io/) jupyterlab extension 
by adding new components and new features on top.

For installing in a Jupyter Lab environment:

    pip install tvb-ext-xircuits


For dev mode setup there are 2 alternatives:
1. Using `jlpm`:

    `jlpm` is a JupyterLab-provided, locked version of `yarn` and has a similar usage:

    ```
    conda activate [my-env]
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -e .
    jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite  # Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
    jupyter server extension enable tvbextxircuits  # Enable the server extension
    tvbextxircuits
    ```

2. Using `yarn`:

    You need to have a dedicated `Python env`, `yarn`, `rust` and `cargo` (from https://rustup.rs/) prepared:
   
    ```
    conda activate [my-env]
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -e .
    yarn install
    yarn install:extension
    tvbextxircuits
    ```
    
To rebuild the extension after making changes to it:

      # Rebuild Typescript source after making changes
      jlpm build
      # Rebuild extension after making any changes
      jupyter lab build

To rebuild automatically:

      # Watch the source directory in another terminal tab
      jlpm run watch
      # Run Xircuits in watch mode in one terminal tab
      jupyter lab --watch
